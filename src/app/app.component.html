<p>
  Due to webpack 5, an application stopped working after migrating from Angular Version 11 to 12.
  This is a minimal example to show a solution for Angular 12 with ngx-build-plus {{title}}.

  The problem is caused by an external dependency (JupyterCellComponent) which is importing SVG files as if they were ECMA modules.
