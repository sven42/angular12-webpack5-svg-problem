<p>
  Due to webpack 5, an application stopped working after migrating from Angular Version 11 to 12.
  This is a minimal example to show this problem with Angular {{angularVersion}}.

<p>
  The problem is caused by an external dependency (JupyterCellComponent) which uses webpacks <i>requires()</i> to import some SVG-Images.
